      <description>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://sandldan.com/images/posts/books/drive/drive.jpg&#34; width=&#34;30%&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Great book for managers and organizational leaders to read. Studies motivation at work, extrinsic vs intrinsic motivations. The first chapter lays out the hypothesis while the rest of the chapters tries to back this up through various examples, the last chapter instead takes a very practical path - listing actionable strategies for many different situations, also including a nice further reading list.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://sandldan.com/images/posts/books/bbt/bbt.jpg&#34; width=&#34;30%&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I started reading this book with the wrongful assumption that it would be technology focused, I had been led to believe this as the book has been mentioned in those circles many times. So what is the book actually about? Failure - and what happens when we can successfully keep learning from failure. The book takes the reader through a mix of interviews, stories and science to convincingly connect it&amp;rsquo;s narrative.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
